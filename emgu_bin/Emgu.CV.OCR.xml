            The language is (usually) an ISO 639-3 string or NULL will default to eng.
            It is entirely safe (and eventually will be efficient too) to call
            Init multiple times on the same instance to change language, or just
            to reset the classifier.
            The language may be a string of the form [~]%lt;lang&gt;[+[~]&lt;lang&gt;]* indicating
            that multiple languages are to be loaded. Eg hin+eng will load Hindi and
            English. Languages may specify internally that they want to be loaded
            with one or more other languages, so the ~ sign is available to override
            that. Eg if hin were set to load eng by default, then hin+~eng would force
            loading only hin. The number of loaded languages is limited only by
            memory, with the caveat that loading additional languages will impact
            both speed and accuracy, as there is more work to do to decide on the
            applicable language, and there is more chance of hallucinating incorrect
            words.
